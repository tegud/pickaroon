# pickaroon
A nodejs logging library

## Why another nodejs logging library

I wanted to experiement with some techniques for logging, including enforcing consistent field naming/standards, request log context as well as Dynamic Log Level (Log Level per request).

Between this library and https://github.com/tegud/pickaroon-express most of my design goals were fulfilled, but in many ways the library is untested and lacking other key functionality (can only log to Console and logstash via udp/tcp).

Input/interest greatfully received.

## Installation:

npm i pickaroon
